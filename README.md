# Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using various health indicators. The goal is to utilize machine learning techniques to accurately predict the presence of heart disease in individuals.

## Overview

The model predicts heart disease based on various features such as demographic data, lifestyle choices, and medical history. It takes data like age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant health metrics to determine the likelihood of heart disease.

## Model and Results

A logistic regression model was trained and achieved an accuracy of **86.78%** in predicting heart disease.
