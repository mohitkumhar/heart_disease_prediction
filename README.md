# Heart Disease Prediction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on health indicators. You can explore a live demo of the model here:

## Overview

The model is designed to analyze various factors that contribute to heart disease, using demographic data, lifestyle choices, and medical history. By evaluating indicators such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, the model determines the probability of heart disease, helping healthcare providers assess risks more effectively.

## Model and Results

A logistic regression model was developed for this task, achieving an accuracy of **86.78%** in predicting heart disease. This result indicates that the model has potential for use in early screening.
